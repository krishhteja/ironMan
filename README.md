A project created out of boredom. It is a voice command system which does some tasks like playing music, searching on google.

This is not a NLP project. Just a project with some voice commands and responses.

Hope will expand its functionalities in the future.

Though there are google APIs for search, I thought doing it via selenium would be more interesting to me :D

Decided to use APIs from different sources and populate more data. Hope will keep expanding this project to more domains.
